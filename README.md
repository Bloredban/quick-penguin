Quick Penguin - Start and end 

The post is dedicated to my first experience in Blender Game Engine, which is destined to become the release, although at first very much. In early January, I took the basic development of the game engine and I was so hooked that eventually turned from a # nedoprototip. Why I decided to call this wonderful animal penguin, to be honest, I do not know, although I know his tail, which was originally a backpack. After a couple of months, I realized that I had hardly finished because very little time and I simply do not get to do anything, in the end, I decided to give it to you, maybe someone he needed more use of health.
